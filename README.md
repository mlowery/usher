(U)niversal (S)hell (H)istory - er

Shell history is possibly the richest source of assistance in the terminal. It's better than a snippets manager (no work create a new snippet). It's better than documentation (your previous commands are already customized for your environment). It's better than a clipboard manager (since you might not have copied the entire command into the clipboard).

But how does one capture history across hosts (ssh), shells (zsh, bash), and logins (root, shared logins, and personal accounts)?

This project is more of a proof of concept and not fully formed. But I felt it was worthwhile to post what I have so far.

## Requirements

* iTerm2 (and macOS)

## How It Works

Essentially, it works like this:

1. Using an iTerm [trigger](https://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html), detect a shell prompt. Then inject some history-dumping shell code using iTerm **Send Text** action. This history-dumping code is triggered on shell exit.
2. Using another iTerm trigger, detect the history dump. Then append it to a file using iTerm **Run Silent Coprocess** action.

## Installation

1. In iTerm preferences, go to **Profiles** > *profile* > **Advanced** > **Triggers** > **Edit**.
2. Click **+**.
3. The **Regular Expression** will vary but here's an example:

```regexp
^\[[\w\-]+@[\w\-]+ [^\s]+\][\#,\$]
```

4. For **Action**, choose **Send Text**.
5. For **Parameters**, below is an example for Bash. Be careful that whatever you put in this box cannot match the **Regular Expression**! Otherwise, you'll watch iTerm send text forever. Note also that this is presented for readability. For the actual value, convert to a single line with semicolons after each newline below. Finally, add `\n` to the end of the whole string.

```bash
if [[ ! $PS1 ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Not Bash"
    sleep 60
fi
PS1='âž•[\u@\h:\W]\$ '
history -c
__hs_dump() {
    echo "# com.matlowery.usher.begin"
    sleep 1
    echo "# begin ${USER-$(whoami)}@${HOSTNAME-$(hostname -f)}"
    history
    echo "# end ${USER-$(whoami)}@${HOSTNAME-$(hostname -f)}"
    echo "# com.matlowery.usher.end"
}
trap __hs_dump EXIT
```

Some notes on the above:
* Changing the prompt is critical to this solution since not changing it would simply give iTerm another regular expression match.
* The in-memory history is cleared (the history file is untouched).
* A function is defined and bound to the `EXIT` trap. This function dumps the history after emitting a string that another iTerm trigger can watch for. Finally, it emits a string that signals to the coprocess that the output is done.
* As a bonus, the current user and host are emitted as well. This is optional.

6. Check **Instant**.
7. Click **+** to add another trigger.
8. The **Regular Expression** must match the "begin" header. Here's an example:

```regexp
^# com\.matlowery\.usher\.begin$
```

9. For **Action**, choose **Run Silent Coprocess**.
10. For **Parameters**, below is a example Bash script. Save it. Make it executable. And enter the path to it in this box.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

while read line; do
    if [[ $line =~ ^#[[:space:]]com.matlowery.usher.end ]]; then
        echo
        exit 0
    fi
    echo "$line" >> ~/.usher
done
```

11. You can leave **Instant** unchecked.
